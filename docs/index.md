# Your AI Should Build Trust, Not Break It

## I Fix Failing RAG Systems That Drive Customers Away — Rapid, Measurable Progress

For funded startups and growth-stage companies losing customers to AI that gives wrong answers.

## Your AI Is Only As Good As What It Can Find

Most companies think AI accuracy comes from better language models. It doesn't.

**Your AI can only be as smart as the information it retrieves.** Poor retrieval = poor AI, regardless of how advanced your LLM is.

While foundation models handle generation, retrieval is where you create competitive advantage. Everyone uses the same LLMs - but your retrieval system is what sets you apart.

The truth is simple: **Better Retrieval → Better AI**

This is why I focus on the retrieval systems that determine what information your AI actually works with. Fix retrieval, fix your AI.

## When Your AI Breaks Customer Trust

When your AI gives wrong answers, it's not just a technical issue — it's a business problem.

Here's what I typically see:

- **Trust erosion**: Users learn they can't rely on your AI, so they stop using it altogether
- **Retrieval failures**: Your knowledge base has the right answers, but your RAG can't find them
- **Support burden**: Every AI mistake creates a support ticket, scaling costs instead of reducing them
- **Missed opportunity**: While you debug, competitors ship AI that delights customers

The good news? These are solvable problems. With the right retrieval architecture, your RAG can become a genuine competitive advantage.

## Proven Results: Systematic Improvements That Drive Business Impact

### Legal Tech: Unusable AI → First Enterprise Contract in 4 Months

**Challenge**: A regulatory compliance platform's AI assistant couldn't accurately retrieve from EU legal databases - 20% accuracy made it unusable for production  

**Root Cause**: Generic document processing failed with complex legal document structures, multilingual content, and hierarchical legal relationships  

**Solution**: Built specialized parsing pipeline for legal documents + domain-aware retrieval system optimized for regulatory queries  

**Result**:

- Month 1: Achieved **70% accuracy** (3.5x improvement)
- Month 4: Platform secured first major enterprise contract
- **Key Insight**: 50% of accuracy issues came from document structure understanding, not the large language model

### carVertical: 10-Second Response Times → 78ms (Production Ready)

**Challenge**: AI vehicle data matching system was unusable in production - 10-second response times made real-time vehicle identification impossible  

**Root Cause**: Complex neural encoder was overkill for standardizing vehicle titles like "VW Golf 2005 TDI Wagon" into structured make/model/variant data  

**Solution**: Multi-stage hybrid approach: TF-IDF first pass for exact matches, XGBoost classifier fallback for ambiguous cases  

**Result**:

- Response time: **10s → 78ms** (128x faster)
- Infrastructure costs: **86% reduction** by eliminating GPU dependency
- Model retraining: **80% cheaper** and 4x faster (CPU-only pipeline)
- **Key Insight**: Simple lexical matching + smart classification often beats complex neural networks for structured data extraction

### HomeToGo: 10% More Bookings Through Strategic Reranking

**Challenge**: Could we improve direct booking conversion rates beyond the existing multi-model ranking system that already optimized for CTR, bookings, and revenue?  

**Hypothesis**: Adding a specialized direct booking reranking layer would further improve conversions without disrupting the core ranking infrastructure  

**Solution**: Built pairwise reranking system that operated on non-paid positions, specifically optimizing for direct booking behavior while preserving existing CTR-based ranking  

**Result**:

- **10% increase** in direct bookings from A/B testing
- Improved conversion rates without cannibalizing existing revenue streams
- Demonstrated that specialized reranking can enhance sophisticated ranking systems
- **Key Insight**: Even mature ranking systems can benefit from targeted optimization layers for specific business objectives

## How We Work Together

I work with a limited number of clients who need their AI systems to perform at the level their business demands.

**My specialized focus areas:**

- Complex document retrieval (legal, regulatory, technical)
- Search ranking and conversion optimization  
- Hybrid retrieval architectures for performance/cost optimization
- Production evaluation systems that catch errors before customers do

**Engagement approach:**

- Start with business impact assessment (what are current problems costing you?)
- Systematic experimentation with measurable milestones
- Full knowledge transfer - you own everything and can maintain it independently
- Project-based pricing tied to outcomes, not hours

**Minimum investment is $25,000** based on scope and business value delivered.

You own all code, documentation, and IP. No vendor lock-in.

## The Right Questions First

Most consultants jump straight into solutions. I start with the questions that matter:

**"Everything in search is trade-off. Have you got the trade-offs right?"**

When companies say "Can you make the AI better," it's always about budget:
- Is 9% improvement worth the cost of ownership?
- Is it worth the latency hit? 
- Is it worth the maintenance complexity?

The best solution isn't always the most technically sophisticated one.

## Risk-Free Results Guarantee

**50% upfront, 50% on hitting your success metrics**

If we don't hit our agreed targets, you get a 50% refund.

Success metrics are objective and measurable - established during our initial assessment based on your current performance and business goals. No subjective judgment calls.

This ensures we're both invested in your success while limiting your risk.

## Our Partnership Process

Every engagement follows the same proven approach:

- **Assessment first** - Understand your current system and business impact
- **Measurable milestones** - Track progress with clear metrics throughout
- **Knowledge transfer** - Your team learns alongside implementation
- **Full independence** - You own and can maintain everything we build

## Who This Is For (And Not For)

**Perfect Fit:**

- Funded startups and growth-stage companies
- AI systems impacting customer experience or business operations
- Technical teams that can implement recommendations
- Decision-makers who can move quickly (not committee-driven)
- Value expertise and willing to invest in quality solutions

**May not be the right fit:**

- Organizations requiring large consulting teams
- Committee-driven decision making processes
- Staff augmentation or hourly-based work
- Projects outside of RAG systems and agents

## About Me

I'm Erikas, a Machine Learning Engineer turned independent consultant. After building production AI systems at [HomeToGo](https://www.hometogo.com) (May 2018 - Feb 2023) and [carVertical](https://www.carvertical.com) (May 2023 - Sep 2024), I now help companies build RAG systems that customers actually trust.

Everyone has access to the same foundation models. The real competitive advantage lies in what information you feed them. While others chase the latest foundation models, I build the retrieval foundations that create lasting competitive advantages.

When I'm not optimizing search pipelines or building evaluation frameworks, you'll find me sharing technical insights on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikas-valinskas-737651135/) and [X](https://x.com/erikasvio).
