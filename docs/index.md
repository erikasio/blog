# Your RAG Is Failing. I Fix It

## I Fix Failing RAG Systems That Drive Customers Away — Rapid, Measurable Progress

For funded startups and growth-stage companies losing customers to AI that gives wrong answers.

## Your AI Is Only As Good As What It Can Find

Most companies think better AI comes from better foundation models. It doesn't.

**Your AI can only be as good as the information it retrieves.** Poor retrieval = poor AI, regardless of how advanced your LLM is.

While foundation models handle generation, retrieval is where you create competitive advantage. Everyone uses the same LLMs - but your retrieval system is what sets you apart.

The truth is simple: **Better Retrieval → Better AI**

## When Your AI Breaks Customer Trust

When your AI gives wrong answers, it's not just a technical issue — it's a business problem.

Here's what I typically see:

- **Trust erosion**: Users learn they can't rely on your AI, so they stop using it altogether
- **Retrieval failures**: Your knowledge base has the right answers, but your RAG can't find them
- **Support burden**: Every AI mistake creates a support ticket, scaling costs instead of reducing them
- **Missed opportunity**: While you debug, competitors ship AI that delights customers

The good news? These are solvable problems. With the right retrieval architecture, your RAG can become a genuine competitive advantage.

## Proven Results: Systematic Improvements That Drive Business Impact

### Legal Tech: 20% → 70% Accuracy in 4 Months

**Challenge**: A regulatory compliance platform's AI agent couldn't accurately retrieve from EU legal databases - 20% accuracy made it unusable for production  

**Root Cause**: Generic document processing failed with complex legal document structures and multilingual content

**Solution**: Built custom document processor for legal texts + legal-specific retrieval system optimized for regulatory queries  

**Result**:

- Achieved **70% accuracy** in first month (3.5x improvement)
- Platform secured first major enterprise contract after 4 months
- **Key Insight**: 50% of accuracy issues came from document structure understanding, not the large language model

### carVertical: 128x Faster, 86% Cheaper Data Standardization

**Challenge**: Processing millions of vehicle records from different sources took 10 seconds per match - making large-scale data standardization impossible  

**Root Cause**: Over-engineered AI model was overkill for matching messy vehicle titles like "volkswagen golf mk5 2.0tdi 05" to standardized database entries  

**Solution**: Built hybrid matching system: fast text matching for obvious cases, AI classification only for ambiguous records  

**Result**:

- Response time: **10s → 78ms** (128x faster)
- Infrastructure costs: **86% reduction** by eliminating GPU dependency
- Model retraining: **80% cheaper** and 4x faster (CPU-only pipeline)
- **Key Insight**: The right tool for the job - maintained accuracy while improving everything else by orders of magnitude

### HomeToGo: 10% More Direct Bookings Through Search Reranking

**Challenge**: HomeToGo's ranking system balanced multiple objectives (clicks, bookings, inquiries) but missed their biggest opportunity - direct platform bookings had the highest lifetime value yet weren't prioritized

**Root Cause**: The existing system treated all conversions equally, missing that direct platform bookings had higher lifetime value than third-party bookings

**Solution**: Built a reranking layer that boosted direct booking properties in search results without disrupting the core ranking infrastructure

**Result**:

- **10% increase** in direct bookings from A/B testing
- No negative impact on overall conversions or revenue
- Proved that mature systems still have optimization opportunities
- **Key Insight**: Sometimes the biggest wins come from optimizing for your most valuable actions, not just any action

## How We Work Together

I work with a limited number of clients who need their AI systems to perform at the level their business demands.

**My specialized focus areas:**

- Complex document parsing and ingestion (legal, regulatory, technical)
- Optimizing retrieval and ranking systems
- Navigating the trade-offs between retrieval accuracy, latency and cost
- Production evaluation systems that catch errors before customers do

**Engagement approach:**

- Start with business impact assessment (what are current problems costing you?)
- Systematic experimentation with measurable milestones
- Full knowledge transfer - you own everything and can maintain it independently
- Project-based pricing tied to outcomes, not hours

You own all code, documentation, and IP. No vendor lock-in.

## Who This Is For (And Not For)

**Perfect Fit:**

- Funded startups and growth-stage companies
- AI systems impacting customer experience or business operations
- Technical teams that can implement recommendations
- Decision-makers who can move quickly (not committee-driven)
- Value expertise and willing to invest in quality solutions

**May not be the right fit:**

- Organizations requiring large consulting teams
- Committee-driven decision making processes
- Staff augmentation or hourly-based work
- Projects outside of RAG systems and agents

**Minimum investment is $25,000** based on scope and business value delivered.
