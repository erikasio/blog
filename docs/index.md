# Services

If you're facing any of these RAG challenges, I can help:

- **Bad user experience**: Your RAG delivers low quality answers and erodes user trust
- **Unclear direction**: Your team is wrestling with the system without a clear path to results
- **Performance issues**: The system takes long to respond and leads to high costs
- **Lack of in-house AI talent**: You need results fast and don't want to waste time hiring the right people first
