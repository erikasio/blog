# Services

If you're facing any of these RAG challenges, I can help:

- **Bad user experience**: Your RAG struggles to consistently deliver high quality answers and erodes user trust
- **Lack of direction**: Your team is endlessly wrestling with the system without a clear path to results
- **Performance issues**: The system takes a long to respond and results in high costs to maintain
- **Lack of in-house AI talent**: You need results fast and don't want to waste months hiring the right people first
