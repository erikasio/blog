# Your AI Should Build Trust, Not Break It

## I Fix RAG Accuracy Problems That Drive Customers Away — Results in 3-5 Months

For funded startups and growth-stage companies whose AI accuracy problems are impacting customer retention and revenue.

## The Hidden Cost of RAG Accuracy Problems

When your AI gives wrong answers, it's not just a technical issue — it's a business problem. Here's what I typically see:

- **Trust erosion**: Users learn they can't rely on your AI, so they stop using it altogether
- **Retrieval failures**: Your knowledge base has the right answers, but your RAG can't find them
- **Support burden**: Every AI mistake creates a support ticket, scaling costs instead of reducing them
- **Missed opportunity**: While you debug, competitors ship AI that delights customers

The good news? These are solvable problems. With the right retrieval architecture, your RAG can become a genuine competitive advantage.

## Proven Results: Systematic Improvements That Drive Business Impact

### Legal Tech Breakthrough: From 20% to 70% Accuracy in 4 Months

**Challenge**: A regulatory compliance platform's AI assistant couldn't accurately retrieve from EU legal databases - 20% accuracy made it unusable for production  
**Root Cause**: Generic document processing failed with complex legal document structures, multilingual content, and hierarchical legal relationships  
**Solution**: Built specialized parsing pipeline for legal documents + domain-aware retrieval system optimized for regulatory queries  
**Result**:

- Month 1: Achieved 70% accuracy (3.5x improvement)
- Month 4: Platform secured first major enterprise contract
- Key Insight: 50% of accuracy issues came from document structure understanding, not the large language model

### 86% Cost Reduction at carVertical

**Challenge**: Vehicle data mapping system was unusable in production - 10-second response times made real-time vehicle identification impossible  
**Root Cause**: Complex neural encoder was overkill for standardizing vehicle titles like "VW Golf 2005 TDI Wagon" into structured make/model/variant data  
**Solution**: Multi-stage hybrid approach: TF-IDF first pass for exact matches, XGBoost classifier fallback for ambiguous cases  
**Result**:

- Response time: 10s → 78ms (128x faster)
- Infrastructure costs: 86% reduction by eliminating GPU dependency
- Model retraining: 80% cheaper and 4x faster (CPU-only pipeline)
- Key Insight: Simple lexical matching + smart classification often beats complex neural networks for structured data extraction

### 10% Booking Increase at HomeToGo

**Challenge**: Could we improve direct booking conversion rates beyond the existing multi-model ranking system that already optimized for CTR, bookings, and revenue?  
**Hypothesis**: Adding a specialized direct booking reranking layer would further improve conversions without disrupting the core ranking infrastructure  
**Solution**: Built pairwise reranking system that operated on non-paid positions, specifically optimizing for direct booking behavior while preserving existing CTR-based ranking  
**Result**:

- 10% increase in direct bookings from A/B testing
- Improved conversion rates without cannibalizing existing revenue streams
- Demonstrated that specialized reranking can enhance sophisticated ranking systems
- Key Insight: Even mature ranking systems can benefit from targeted optimization layers for specific business objectives

## How We Work Together

I work with a limited number of clients who need their AI systems to perform at the level their business demands.

**My specialized focus areas:**

- Complex document retrieval (legal, regulatory, technical)
- Search ranking and conversion optimization  
- Hybrid retrieval architectures for performance/cost optimization
- Production evaluation systems that catch errors before customers do

**Engagement approach:**

- Start with business impact assessment (what are current problems costing you?)
- Systematic experimentation with measurable milestones
- Full knowledge transfer - you own everything and can maintain it independently
- Project-based pricing tied to outcomes, not hours

Engagements typically start at $25,000 based on scope and business value delivered.

You own all code, documentation, and IP. No vendor lock-in.

## My Guarantee: Results or Partial Refund

I'm confident in my approach, so I back it with a guarantee:

- Pay 50% upfront to start the engagement
- Remaining 50% tied to hitting agreed success metrics specific to your situation
- If we don't hit our mutually agreed targets, you get a 50% refund of total project cost

Success metrics are measured through automated testing and objective benchmarks established during our initial assessment based on your current performance and business goals.

This ensures we're both invested in success while limiting your risk.

## Our Partnership Process

Every engagement follows the same proven approach:

- **Assessment first** - Understand your current system and business impact
- **Measurable milestones** - Track progress with clear metrics throughout
- **Knowledge transfer** - Your team learns alongside implementation
- **Full independence** - You own and can maintain everything we build

## Who This Is For (And Not For)

**Perfect Fit:**

- Funded startups and growth-stage companies
- AI systems impacting customer experience or business operations
- Technical teams that can implement recommendations
- Decision-makers who can move quickly (not committee-driven)
- Value expertise and willing to invest in quality solutions

**Not a Fit:**

- Large enterprises (I'm a solo specialist, not a consultancy)
- Pre-revenue startups (focus on product-market fit first)
- Looking for cheapest option or staff augmentation
- Want generic AI advice rather than specialized retrieval optimization

## Start With a Free RAG Systems Assessment

Two ways to move forward:

### Option 1: RAG Systems Assessment Call

30-minute focused call where I'll:

- Diagnose your likely RAG retrieval and accuracy bottlenecks
- Share 2-3 specific improvements you can try immediately
- Discuss if we're a good fit to work together

## About Me

I'm Erikas, a Machine Learning Engineer turned independent consultant. After building production AI systems at [HomeToGo](https://www.hometogo.com) (May 2018 - Feb 2023) and [carVertical](https://www.carvertical.com) (May 2023 - Sep 2024), I now help companies build RAG systems that customers actually trust.

My approach is simple: Better retrieval leads to better AI. Whether it's search ranking, document processing, or data mapping, I focus on the systems that determine what information your AI actually works with.

When I'm not optimizing search pipelines or building evaluation frameworks, you'll find me sharing technical insights on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikas-valinskas-737651135/) and [X](https://x.com/erikasvio).
