Helping clients to improve RAG applications

## About
Helping people to rollout LLM applications to production that deliver business value. My expertise include machine learning, MLOps and ranking systems.

Consider working with me if:
- You need help with moving your RAG application from baseline to a production-ready system
- Suffer from unreliability issues in production
- Can't decide what to prioritize next
- Need help with establishing best practices

## Experience

### Senior AI Engineer
*NFQ 路 Contract*  
*July 2024 - November 2024 (5 months)*  
*Remote*

In 4.5 months helped the client:
- Improve RAG performance (went from Level 1/10 to Level 7/10 on SME-validated question complexity scale in 1 month)
- Reduce time-to-market by transitioning baseline into production-ready AI assistant that secured first paying client within 3 months
- Reduced client efforts by helping to prioritize time and resources strategically

Skills: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, and +11 skills

### Machine Learning Engineer
*carVertical 路 Full-time*  
*May 2023 - September 2024 (1 year 5 months)*

Designed and implemented a new named entity recognition (NER) ML system for automotive data, now the standard across the company:
- Cut inference p99 from 10s to 78ms by reducing system complexity and replacing complex BERT models with XGBoost and hashing trick
- Saved ~86% of inference costs by replacing AWS Sagemaker Endpoints with a custom solution using Docker and AWS Lambda
- Reduced ML training pipeline running times from 40 mins on GPU to 10 mins on CPU and cut its associated costs ~80%

Established MLOps foundation to support full machine learning lifecycle:
- Designed and implemented a modular, containerized ML pipeline architecture using Docker, Airflow, and AWS ECS
- Implemented GitOps practices for ML model versioning and deployment, improving traceability and reproducibility
- Integrated automated testing and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for ML models
